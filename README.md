# Well-Thickness-Diagram
======================

We designed this project to support stratigraphic analysis in geological workflow.

The code cells below allow you to define the thickness interval of each marker by calculating the difference of top marker depth from the input wells. You could enter age, sequence, or formation marker depending on what you are going to use. The difference might support for stratigraphic interpretation in finding the pattern distribution of each interval from well to well.
